==================================================
Supplier Price in Scheduled Manufacturing Products
==================================================

With this module you can estimate the costs based on the cost price or the
purchase price of the scheduled products. It also calculates a total of costs
of products scheduled for the manufacturing order, which can be calculated per
unit produced, which can be configured by adjustments.
There is also the possibility of seeing what would be the cost per scheduled
line per unit produced, in this case filtered by a group of permits.
With this the total production is arranged and in this case it will belong to
the total amount of product to be produced.
